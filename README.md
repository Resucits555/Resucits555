Hi,
I'm just a chair that makes personal projects most of which don't get finished. I have learned C++, lua and C deeply, and have played around with Assembly, Javascript and Java.
I'm very interested in the depths of a computer, near to the metal. That's why I'm not building on top of the big tower of dependencies, but try to understand it's insides, usually studying the base that doesn't use any dependencies at all.

Projects I'm working on, are finished, or I'm planning to start:
- An assembler, that will use it's own syntax, but still similar to the other's
- A highly realistic (in my fantasies) falling powder game, inspired by "The Powder Toy", which I'm playing regularly
- A 2D game engine, because I sometimes find other game engines less configurable than I want them to be. And in general, just to learn something
- Something like an Operating System

Most of these project are written in C++, which I'm slowly losing interest in, as C++ is an old language that is trying to keep up with new needs, while staying backwards compatible, and is simply overfilled with hundreds of extremely specific functions and sometimes has a very confusing syntax. I'm planning to move to C or even learn Go because they're much cleaner and still have decent speed.
And yes, I'm a memory and speed freak, I dislike using more memory than the absolute minimum that I'll find, and make a program as fast as it's reasonably possible, which is stealing a good amount of my time, but is fortunately limited by the language itself, which doesn't bother me at all for some reason.

Best retards,  
Chair
